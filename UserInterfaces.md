# User Interfaces #

## Types Of User Interfaces ##

* CLI - Command Line
* GUI - Graphical User Interface
* MDI - Menu Driven Interface
* FBI - Form Based Interface
* NLI - Natural Language Interface
* *API - Application Programming Interface

## Command Line Interface ##

* Oldest type of interface of the list
* The computer responds to commands typed by the operator
* Requires the user to remember a lot of different commands

## Graphical UI ##

* Usually uses a pointing device (mouse, touchpad, touchscreen)
* The pointer interacts with on-screen elements
* The term was coined in the 1970s to distinguish it from text-based interfaces like the CLI.
* Today nearly all interfaces are GUIs
* PARC was the first commercially available GUI created by Xerox
* Steve Jobs saw the interface during a tour at Xerox and thatâ€™s what inspired the UI for the original Mac OS.

## Menu Driven ##

* Think of an ATM
* Simple and easy to use UI comprised of a series of menus and sub-menus which the users accesses by pressing buttons
* UML can be a good example when designing the architecture of the machine

## Form Based ##

* Uses text-boxes, drop-down menus, text areas, check boxes, radio boxes and buttons 
* Used a lot on websites to gather data from the user

## Natural Language ##

* Spoken Interface where the user interacts by speaking to the computer
* Simulates having a conversation
* Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant and others

## Structuring Code ##

* Your code should separate concerns as best as possible
* Front-end separate from the backend
* Front-end is not always a GUI - it is however the code is interfaced with
* Keep your business logic separate from the interfaces
* Java packages will help you keep your code separated
